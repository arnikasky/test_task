Guide on how to deploy all parts together:

1.  **Prepare your AWS Environment:**

    -   Create a dedicated VPC and a few subnets in your AWS account.

    -   Create an S3 bucket for your Terraform remote state and a DynamoDB table for state locking (e.g., `terraform-state-bucket` and `terraform-lock-table`).

2.  **Provision the EKS Cluster:**

    -   Fill out the `infrastructure/terraform.tfvars.example` file with your `vpc_id` and `subnet_ids`. Rename it to `infrastructure/terraform.tfvars`.

    -   Run `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, and `terraform apply` in directory `infrastructure`. This will provision your EKS cluster.

3.  **Install ArgoCD:**

    -   After the EKS cluster is ready, configure your `kubectl` to connect to it. You can do this by running the AWS CLI command provided in the Terraform output.

    -   Download the full ArgoCD install manifest: `curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml > argocd-install.yaml`

    -   Apply the manifest to your cluster: `kubectl apply -f argocd-install.yaml`

4.  **Set up GitOps:**
 
    -   Create a new Git repository (e.g., on GitHub or GitLab).

    -   Copy the `helm-chart` directory and the `argocd-manifests` directory into this new repository.

    -   Update the `argocd-manifests/app.yaml` file to use your new Git repository URL and branch name.

    -   Commit and push your changes to the `master` branch.

    -   Finally, tell ArgoCD to deploy your app by applying the `app.yaml` manifest: `kubectl apply -f argocd-manifests/app.yaml`

ArgoCD will now automatically detect the manifest in your Git repository and deploy the `test-app` Helm chart to your EKS cluster. Any future changes you make to the Helm chart and push to Git will be automatically synced by ArgoCD.

This setup provides a great starting point. Let me know if you would like to dive deeper into any of these components, such as adding a CI pipeline or configuring more advanced security for ArgoCD.
